<h1>Process</h1>
<p>I decided to try and improve the Gif Finder that we made for a homework assignment.  First thing I did was get my own GIPHY API key, due to the one we were provided being taken down.  The enxt thing I did was rearrange some of the stuff on the page, mainly the search bar, button, adn the max gifs that load on the page.  I had changed the background image for the title, making it dogs instead of cats, as well as the title of the page, even making the title change colors on a timer.  I had modified the page so it would adapt to the size of the screen changing, by making all of the search stuff stack.  The final thing I did for the search bar section is make it stick to the top of the screen once a certain distance is scrolled down, making it easy to search up more gifs, as well as have it reset to the top when a new search is done. After that is when I started adding in all of the new stuff that was not present on the original homework assignment.  I had used different images for the image not found and the logo and while the search button has a similar shape, I have changed the color as well as the text that is present in on it.  I had also added in even more buttons, each one doing something different form the search button, from increasing and decreasing the total number of gifs to copying the gif url.</p>

<h1>Special Stuff</h1>
<p>The thing I am most proud of was the copy gif link button.  This allows you to copy the link of the gif to the clipboard, allowing you to put the url of the gif into the browser and view it from there.  I did this by creating a for loop and an array of urls. which I then saved to each button, allowing for each one to have a different link, each one associated with the gif they are above.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>I had met most of the requirements.  I had gotten and implemented my own GIPHY API key, I had implemented a next/previous function that allows for more images to load on screen.  I had also created a copy gif url button, which allows you to get the url of the gif copied to the clipboard.  I was unfortunately unable to implement the spinner when stuff is loading, I am also unsure if I implemented enough new features.</p>

<h1>Overall Grade</h1>
<p>I beleive I got something between a B- and A-, I think I did good on some parts of the webpage, but there are some things I was unable to figure out, such as implementing a loading screen.  I am also unsure if I had added in enough new features that count as new features. But I am confident that I have done a good amoutn fo stuff for this assignment.</p>
