    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <h2><ol>
        <li>Current goal of portfolio is to have a way for people to access my projects, as well as use for applying for jobs.</li>
        <li>Current audience is job recruiters.</li>
        <li>Flex was mainly used for the design of the portfolio.</li>
        <li>The website starts with the title and tagline, then the nav bar, then the about me section, then the project section adn then finally the contact section.</li>
        <li>Had the title of the portfolio at the top, alongside the tagline, and placed it in the top left corner.</li>
        <li>Created the nav bar with it linking to the about section, project section, contact section and resume.</li>
        <li>Made the position of the nav bar sticky, and it would stay at the top of the screen after scrolling down a certain distance.</li>
        <li>Centered my picture and had the about me paragraph aligned to the left.</li>
        <li>Made it so my picture will stay a certain size after the webpage is a certain width.</li>
        <li>In the project section, I lined up the projects in a row in full screen, I had also made the pictures into hyperlinks to the projects, which are currently dummy links.</li>
        <li>After the webpage reaches a certain width, the projects will turn into a column to make it easier to see on smaller windows.</li>
        <li>For the project pictures I am currently using placeholder images, which will be replaced once projects are made.</li>
        <li>Projects will also have proper hyperlinks eventually.</li>
        <li>The contact info sections has my phone number, email and a hyperlink to my LinkedIn.</li>
        <li>Used <a href="https://placeholder.com/">https://placeholder.com/</a> for the placeholder images</li>
        <li>Will also add a link to a GitHub with all of the work I have done once it is set up.</li>
