                        <br><br>Technologies used: Query Selector, innerHTML, Slice, on Change, Parent Elements, Javascript
                        <br><br>Role in Project: My role in this project was getting it work based on the instructions provided, while we were given an example on what the project was supposed to look like, we had to design everything one our own.
                        <br><br>What I learned: What I learned during this was what Javascript can do.  How much it can change the way a web page works, which was astounding to see after working with it.
                        <br><br>Challenges: I do think I had any challenges when it came to the coding of this assignment.  I think the most challenge I has is choosing the character for the site.</p>

                        <p>Description: This was a project that I had worked on for a class.  This was originally a homework assignment but I decided to try and modify it and make it better than it originally was.  Using a GIPHY API key I was able to pull gifs from the GIPHY website and have them display on the webpage.  When a user types in the specified gifs they want to looks up, like a dog or fish.  The search will then be used to search up what you are looking for and then load them up on the web page.  There is an option to load in more or less gifs on the page by pushing the buttons at the bottom.  If you hover over the gifs with your mouse they will get bigger in size, allowing to view them much more easily.  Also, you can copy the gif url to your clipboard by clicking the button right above the image, with the rating and a direct link to the GIPHY page right above it.
                        <br><br>Technologies used: Copy to Clipboard, Using user input to look something up, saving something to local storage, load in more or less images, Javascript
                        <br><br>Role in Project: My role in this project was trying to get the Gif FInder to be different form what it had originally looked like.  This meant adding in new stuff, changing the layout and design of certain things like the search bar and the title.  
                        <br><br>What I learned: I learned during this assignment how much much Javascript can affect a webpage, while it would not be my first time using Javascript, due to having many other assignments before it that relied heavily on Javascript, it still astounds me.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The main challenges I had was what new things I would add into the Gif FInder to make it different from the original assignment.</p>

                        <p>Description: This was another project I had worked on, an updated version of one of my homework assignments that was known as Circle Blast!  I decided to modify and try to make it different from the source material.  One of the main differences is that you are able to choose between four different ships, each one having a different way of firing.  There are also two new aliens that were not in the original assignment, as well as your high score being stored in local storage.
                            <br><br>Technologies used: Classes, pushing objects, Scenes, Howl, PIXI, Sprites, Local Storage, Javascript
                            <br><br>Role in Project: My role in this project was getting the game to be as unique as possible, make it as different as possible from the assignment it was based on.
                            <br><br>What I learned: What I learned during this assignment was how much I have grown from when I first learned Javascript.  While I definitely still have mroe to learn, I think that my skills with Javascript have grown.
                            <br><br>Challenges: The main challenge that I had for this assignment was figuring out how to change the sprite depending on what button you pressed.  For some time, I had been unable to figure that out, with the last sprite loaded in always being the one used.  I was able to solve this issue though by removing the default ship from the game scene, that being the first ship.  I would then use a function to load in a new ship with the new ship sprite.  I also used these same functions to change the firing types of each ship.</p>

                        <p>Description: This was a project I had worked on during my time learning about Web Applications, a webpage that uses an API to print out cards onto the page.  The particular API I had used was a Pokemon GO API, I had chose this one because it is based around the series that I know well.
                        <br><br>Technologies used: FireBase, Local Storage, API, Bulma
                        <br><br>Role in Project: My role for this project was to create a page that produces cards based on the information collected from the API.  We were provided multiple options when it came to the APi we used, each one having different data as well as format style, making it intriguing to figure out how to get that data to print onto the screen correctly.
                        <br><br>What I learned: During the time I had put into working on this project I had learned a lot on how FireBase works, which was interesting to find out.  I had also learned more on the different ways APIs set up data, with some giving you different sections of data with each one in the form of a JSON, or just a singlular JSON file with all of the information needed.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The main challenge I had when it came to this project was getting the information form the JSON file stored within the API.</p>

                        <p>Description: This was my final project that I had created for the Web Applications course I had taken, an Audio Visualizer that uses Audio to manipulate the drawing that is present on the canvas.  
                        <br><br>Technologies used: Canvas, Audio and Video Elements, Manipulating Canvas using Audio
                        <br><br>Role in Project: I was tasked in creating something using canvas, an HTML element that allows the user to draw graphics onto the web page.  Using one of my past assignments, an audio visualizer, I modified to make it as different as possible to the original assignment.  This includes changing the overall design of the visualizer, changing the music to match with the new aesthetic, to even adding in brand new elements, like having video play through the canvas element.
                        <br><br>What I learned: During this project I had learned how to make a video element play through a canvas element, mkaing it possible to have the video be affected by the filters created using canvas.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The main challenge that I had with this project was figuring out how to make it as different to the original assignement as possible.</p>

                        <br><br>What I learned: During this assignment I learned how to create object variables and then store them into an array.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The warning challenge of this was creating the object variable itself, due to this being the first time I had worked with them.</p>

                        <p>Description: This is two different programs, the first one replicates how a stack works, where variables are pushed(added) in from the front of the stack and the last variable in the stack is popped(removed).  While the other replicates how a queue works, where variables are queued(added) in to the front of the queue and the variable at the front of the queue is dequeued(removed).  The queue program also sorts the values in the queue from least to greatest.
                        <br><br>Technologies used: Push/Queue, Pop/Dequeue, Template Classes, Pointers, Arrays
                        <br><br>Role in Project: My task for both of these programs was to replicate how a stack and a queue function.  That includes being able to add values to the front of the stack/queue and remove from the back of the stack and the front of the queue.
                        <br><br>What I learned: I learned the inner machinations of both a stack and a queue.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The warning challenge between the two programs was getting the pop/dequeue methods working, mainly due to having to worry about the program crashing because the size of the array that the items are stored in has become too small.</p>

                        <p>Description: This is Gravity Snake, a game that has a similar game loop to the game Snake.  The main difference being that you have full control of what way you are going, so you are able to go in any direction you want.  You goal is to collect the five circles in the shortest amount of key-presses possible.
                        <br><br>Technologies used: Box2D, SFML, Keyboard Input, Random/Time
                        <br><br>Role in Project: My task was creating a Graphical version of a previous assignment, also know as Gravity Snake.  The original Gravity Snake consisted of only the coordinates of both the target and the snake, all in text in the output window.
                        <br><br>What I learned: During this I had learned how to work with Box2D, the engine used to create the visuals for the game as well as the physics for the square that the player plays as.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The challenge working on this was working with Box2D, since this was the first time I had worked with the engine.</p>

Get to the end of the level while using your trusty wire to power generators to create platforms and remove obstacles to help you advance.  Play through six levels to test your skill in platforming and if you want to test your skill, try and beat the extra level that playtesters struggled to beat.
                        <br><br>Technologies used: Enumerations, Player Input, Abstract Classes, File IO, MonoGame, Parent/Child Classes, Finite State Machine, SortedList, Vector2, Coyote Frames
                        <br><br>Role in Project: My task in this project was designing the levels using the sprite sheets we created.  I did this by creatign the level layouts in text files that would be sent into the program and choose the correct sprites based on that.  I also was in charge of debugging and lcoating any issues that arose in the code.
                        <br><br>What I learned: During this project I leanred what it was like to work on a program/game in a team environment as well as how to coordinate between members so that work would be done efficiently.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The warning challenge when working on this project was figuring out how some things would work, like the wire that the robot carries around as well as the generators that would activate or deactivate the platforms.</p>

                        <p>Description: This program is a simulation of a battle between four different character with two having the class of swordsmans while the other two had the class of archer.  The four characters would fight each other in a round based format, with the winner being the last one standing.
                        <br><br>Technologies used: Classes, Inheritance, Override Methods, While Loops
                        <br><br>Role in Project: My task for this assignment was to create another class besides the original one I made, that being the swordsman.  I then needed to set it up so that they would fight each other till there was only one left.
                        <br><br>What I learned: During this assignment I learned more about how class inheritance works in C# and how multiple classes can inherit from the same one.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The warning challenge was getting the four characters hit random targets and not themselves,  I also had to come up with ideas on how to make the two classes balanced so one wasn;t better than the other.</p>

                        <br><br>What I learned: I learned during my work on this assignment how to constantly change the user input and add it to the final count by using a while loop to keep prompting the user for values.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The primary challenge when working on this assignment was figuring out how assembly language works since it was my first time using it.</p>

                        <br><br>What I learned: I figured out how to compare different variables using if statements, then modify another variables using the statement itself.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The challenge was comparing the three values the user was inputting.  There would be times where after the first value compared itself with the second value it would not compare with the final value.</p>

                        <br><br>Role in Assignment: My role was to create a puzzle level in a 3D environment, that environment being the game, "Portal 2".  I wanted to create something that had challenge to it, but not be too difficult that players found it frustrating to play.  That is when I came up with the idea of the level, have the level start out small, then get bigger and a little more challenging as you progressed through the pyramid.
                        <br><br>What I learned: During this project I learned what it was like to work on a level in 3D.  Compered to levels created in a 2D environment, levels created in 3D have a lot more work needed to be put into it due to the new perspective as well as the addition of the z-axis.  This also ended up with the napkin sketch being a lot more important.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The challenge when it came to working on this was figuring out how to make sure that the segments of the level were increasing in difficulty while still being fair.  This took a lot of trial and error as well as relying on feedback I received during playtests.</p>

                        <p>Description: Seems the cats have decided to mix up the level, this time letting you pick what path you take to continue forward. Have they decided to go easy on you, or are they just looking for a more twisted form of entertainment?

                        <br><br>Role in Assignment: My role was I had to create a 2D platformer level in the game, "BattleBlock Theater," making it possible for me to get used to creating levels.  I wanted to create a level that allowed the player to choose how they progressed, this is how I ended up coming up with the idea of the splitting paths.  I wanted to add another set of split paths but did not have enough room to put them in, so I stuck with two and added a final jump challenge at the end.
                        <br><br>What I learned: What I learned during this assignment was how to create a level, this being the first one I created for the class.  I also learned the work that goes into creating a level, from the rough sketch of the level I wanted to create to the restrictions that appear once you start working on the level to the final product.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The primary challenge was adjusting the level so that it would fit into the max level size the game allows.  My original sketch was too big for the game so I had to downsize it, makingme choose what parts of the original design I wanted to keep and what ones I wanted to remove.</p>

                        <p>Description: Seems the cats have decided to mix up the level, this time letting you pick what path you take to continue forward. Have they decided to go easy on you, or are they just looking for a more twisted form of entertainment?
                        <br><br>Technologies used: Classic Maps, Sticky Blocks, Lasers, Moving Platforms, Springs, Collectibles, Goal Post, Lava, Ice Blocks, Pushing Blocks, Light Platforms, Saw Blades, Exploding Platforms
                        <br><br>Role in Assignment: My role was I had to create a 2D platformer level in the game, "BattleBlock Theater," making it possible for me to get used to creating levels.  I wanted to create a level that allowed the player to choose how they progressed, this is how I ended up coming up with the idea of the splitting paths.  I wanted to add another set of split paths but did not have enough room to put them in, so I stuck with two and added a final jump challenge at the end.
                        <br><br>What I learned: What I learned during this assignment was how to create a level, this being the first one I created for the class.  I also learned the work that goes into creating a level, from the rough sketch of the level I wanted to create to the restrictions that appear once you start working on the level to the final product.
                        <br><br>Challenges: The primary challenge was adjusting the level so that it would fit into the max level size the game allows.  My original sketch was too big for the game so I had to downsize it, makingme choose what parts of the original design I wanted to keep and what ones I wanted to remove.</p>
