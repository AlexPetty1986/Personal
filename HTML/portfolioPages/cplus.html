                    <h2>Cash Register</h2>
                    <p>Description: The player is shown a variety of items and their current stock of each.  They will input the number associated with the item and then be asked how many they would like to purchase.  After they chose the item and quantity, the screen will print out the price before tax, the tax and then the sum of the two showing the final price of the purchase.  They will then be asked if they would like to buy another item, yes continues the code while no exits it.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: While Loops, If Statements, User Input, Objects/Object Arrays
                    <br><br>Role in Project: My task was setting up an array that took object variables, those being the items and their quantity and prices, then printing them out on the screen.  After this getting user input to determine what item they want to buy and how many they want.
                    <br><br>What I learned: During this assignment I learned how to create object variables and then store them into an array.
                    <br><br>Challenges: The primary challenge of this was creating the object variable itself, due to this being the first time I had worked with them.</p>

                    <h2>Stack/Queue</h2>
                    <p>Description: This is two different programs, the first one replicates how a stack works, where variables are pushed(added) in from the front of the stack and the last variable in the stack is popped(removed).  While the other replicates how a queue works, where variables are queued(added) in to the front of the queue and the variable at the front of the queue is dequeued(removed).  The queue program also sorts the values in the queue from least to greatest
                    <br><br>Technologies used: Push/Queue, Pop/Dequeue, Template Classes, Pointers, Arrays
                    <br><br>Role in Project: My task for both of these programs was to replicate how a stack and a queue function.  That includes being able to add values to the front of the stack/queue and remove from the back of the stack and the front of the queue.
                    <br><br>What I learned: 
                    <br><br>Challenges: The primary challenge between the two programs was getting the pop/dequeue methods working, mainly due to having to worry about the program crashing because the size of the array that the items are stored in has become too small.</p>

                    <h2>Gravity Snake</h2>
                    <p>Description: This is Gravity Snake, a game that has a similar game loop to the game Snake.  The main difference being that you have full control of what way you are going, so you are able to go in any direction you want.  You goal is to collect the five circles in the shortest amount of key-presses possible.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: Box2D, SFML, Keyboard Input, Random/Time
                    <br><br>Role in Project: My task was creating a Graphical version of a previous assignment, also know as Gravity Snake.  The original Gravity Snake consisted of only the coordinates of both the target and the snake, all in text in the output window.
                    <br><br>What I learned: During this I had learned how to work with Box2D, the engine used to create the visuals for the game as well as the physics for the square that the player plays as.
                    <br><br>Challenges: The challenge working on this was working with Box2D, since this was the first time I had worked with the engine.</p>
