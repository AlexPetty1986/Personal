                    <h2>Adventure</h2>
                    <p>Description: A python program/game using arrays and while loops to simulate a text based game where you are exploring different rooms of a mansion.  Typing in a letter representing one of the cardinal directions allows you to keep exploring, or run into a wall.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: Arrays, Append, While Loops, User Input
                    <br><br>Role in Assignment: My role was to make it possible to change rooms based on the users current location.  If they were in one room, they would only be able to enter rooms that are adjacent to them.
                    <br><br>What I learned: 
                    <br><br>Challenges: The primary challenge when working on this was figuring out how to cahgne what rooms you are able to enter based on your current location.</p>

                    <h2>Legend of Zelda: Dungeon Crawler</h2>
                    <p>Description: A python program/game that plays like a Camel Game, wherre you must reach the end before you are either caught by whatever is chasing you or from exhaustion or dehydration.  The spin on this one is that is based on the Legend of Zelda series, with you playing as Link while you are being chased through a dungeon by Dark Link.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: While Loops, If/Else If Statements, Random, Boolean Values
