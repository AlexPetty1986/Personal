                    <h2>Mansion Adventure</h2>
                    <p>Description: A python program/game using arrays and while loops to simulate a text based game where you are exploring different rooms of a mansion.  Typing in a letter representing one of the cardinal directions allows you to keep exploring, or run into a wall.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: Arrays, Append, While Loops, User Input
                    <br><br>Role in Assignment: My role was to make it possible to change rooms based on the users current location.  If they were in one room, they would only be able to enter rooms that are adjacent to them.
                    <br><br>What I learned: I learned how to use while loops, as well as see how helpful they are in keeping a program in motion and not having it stop.
                    <br><br>Challenges: The primary challenge when working on this was figuring out how to change what rooms you are able to enter based on your current location.</p>

                    <h2>Legend of Zelda: Dungeon Crawler</h2>
                    <p>Description: A python program/game that plays like a Camel Game, where you must reach the end before you are either caught by whatever is chasing you or from exhaustion or dehydration.  The spin on this one is that is based on the Legend of Zelda series, with you playing as Link while you are being chased through a dungeon by Dark Link.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: While Loops, If/Else If Statements, Random, Boolean Values
                    <br><br>Role in Assignment: My role while working on this was to create a game that plays similarily, while also adding to it seem different.
                    <br><br>What I learned: I learned how to expand my usage of user input, making it possible to ask for different kinds of inputs, especially ones that would not affect what the user is doing. 
                    <br><br>Challenges: The challenges that I had with this was balancing the game.  I don't want the player to die of dehydration or exhaustion after just a couple of turns.  I also don't want Dark Link to reach the player after a certain amount of time either.</p>

                    <h2>Video Game Quiz Show</h2>
                    <p>Description: A python program that quizzes the user on their video game knowledge.  Each answer they get right will reward them with points, getting it wrong results in losing points.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: If/Else If Statements, User Input
                    <br><br>Role in Assignment: My role was to create a program that takes in user input and is used in if statements, while also being fun at the same time.
                    <br><br>What I learned: I was able to understand how to use user input to affect if statements.
                    <br><br>Challenges: The primary challenge was figuring out what kinds of questions I wanted to ask.</p>
