                    <h2>Add Count</h2>
                    <p>Description: This program will continuously add numbers inputted by the user until -1 is typed in.  It will print the total sum of all numbers used as well as how many numbers were used in total, not including the variable the user uses to quit the program.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: While Loops, User Input, Addition, Printing to Screen, Storing Values in Variables
                    <br><br>Role in Assignment: My role in this assignment was to get the integers to add up, not including the integer the user will put in to quit the program.
                    <br><br>What I learned: I learned during my work on this assignment how to constantly change the user input and add it to the final count by using a while loop to keep prompting the user for values.
                    <br><br>Challenges: The primary challenges when working on this assignment was </p>

                    <img src="../portfolioPages/media/aslangProj2.png" alt="Largest" id="langImg2"/></a>
                    <h2>Find Largest</h2>
                    <p>Description: The program will prompt the user for three numbers, once that is done it will determine which of the 3 is the largest number.  It will then prompt the user asking them if they want to keep going or quit.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: User Input, If Statements, While Loops, Storing Values in Variables
                    <br><br>Role in Assignment: My role in this assignment was getting the code to compare three different integers to see which of the three is the largest.
                    <br><br>What I learned: I figured out how to compare different variables using if statements, then modify another variables using the statement itself.
                    <br><br>Challenges: The challenge was comparing the three values the user was inputting.  There would be times where after the first value compared itself with the second value it would not compare with the final value.</p>

                    <h2>Sum & Average</h2>
                    <p>Description: The user will be prompted to input three different integer values.  Once they have inputted them, the program will print out the total sum as well as the average of the sum rounded to the nearest integer.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: User Input, Addition, Division, Storing Values in Variables
                    <br><br>Role in Assignment: I was tasked with getting the total sum and rounded average of the three numbers inputted by the user.
                    <br><br>What I learned: This assignment I learned how to modify a variable using other variables, these ones being the ones inputted by the user themselves.
                    <br><br>Challenges: The primary challenge was getting the average to figure out whether to round up or down depending on the actual total.</p>
