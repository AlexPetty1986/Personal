                    <p>Description: This is one of my homework assignments, a webpage that will print out a random phrase every time the button is pressed or the page is reset.  I decided to choose the video game character Gex from, "Gex," because he has some funny quotes.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: Query Selector, innerHTML, Slice, on Change, Parent Elements, Javascript
                    <br><br>Role in Project: My role in this project was getting it work based on the instructions provided, while we were given an example on what the project was supposed to look like, we had to design everything one our own.
                    <br><br>What I learned: What I learned during this was what Javascript can do.  How much it can change the way a web page works, which was astounding to see after working with it.
                    <br><br>Challenges: I do not think I had any challenges when it came to the coding of this assignment.  I think the most challenge I has is choosing the character for the site.</p>

                    <p>Description: This is a Gif Finder.  This was originally a homework assignment but I decided to try and modify it and make it better than it originally was.  Using a GIPHY API key I was able to pull gifs from the GIPHY website and have them display on the webpage.  When a user types in the specified gifs they want to looks up, like a dog or fish.  The search will then be used to search up what you are looking for and then load them up on the web page.  There is an option to load in more or less gifs on the page by pushing the buttons at the bottom.  If you hover over the gifs with your mouse they will get bigger in size, allowing to view them much more easily.  Also, you can copy the gif url to your clipboard by clicking the button right above the image, with the rating and a direct link to the GIPHY page right above it.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: Copy to Clipboard, Using user input to look something up, saving something to local storage, load in more or less images, Javascript
                    <br><br>Role in Project: My role in this project was trying to get the Gif FInder to be different form what it had originally looked like.  This meant adding in new stuff, changing the layout and design of certain things like the search bar adn the title.  
                    <br><br>What I learned: I learned during this assignment how much much Javascript can affect a webpage, while it would not be my first time using Javascript, due to having many other assignments before it that relied ehavily on Javascript, it still astounds me.
                    <br><br>Challenges: The main challenges I had was what new things I would add into the Gif FInder to make it different from the</p>

                    <a href="./HTML/project3/game.html"><h2>Alien Defender!</h2></a>
                    <p>Description: This was an updated version of one of our homework assignments that was known as Circle Blast!  I decided to modify and try to make it different from the source material.  One of the main differences is that you are able to choose between four different ships, each one having a different way of firing.  There are also two new aliens that were not in the original assignment, as well as your high score being stored in local storage.
                    <br><br>Technologies used: Classes, pushing objects, Scenes, Howl, PIXI, Sprites, Local Storage, Javascript
                    <br><br>Role in Project: My role in this project was getting the game to be as unique as possible, make it as different as possible from the assignment it was based on.
                    <br><br>What I learned: What I learned during this assignment was how much I have grown from when I first learned Javascript.  While I definitely still have mroe to learn, I think that my skills with Javascript have grown.
                    <br><br>Challenges: The main challenge that I had for this assignment was figuring out how to change the sprite depending on what button you pressed.  For some time, I had been unable to figure that out, with the last sprite loaded in always being the one used.  I was able to solve this issue though by removing the default ship from the game scene, that being the first ship.  I would then use a function to load in a new ship with the new ship sprite.  I also used these same functions to change the firing types of each ship.</p>
