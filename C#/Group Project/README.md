This was a group project that I was a part of for a C# course I was taking. The project was to work
in a group and create a game using Monogame, a framework designed for making games using C#.  This game was known as LiveWire, a platformer where you play as a little robot that is trying to 
relight the world after the power goes out.  I was in charge of level design and playtesting, 
but also helped other members with any issues that they ended up having when it came to their parts of 
the project.  I also gave some ideas when it came to the overall gameplay loop and game genre, with 
some being used in the final project.
