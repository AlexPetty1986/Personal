This was a group project that I was a part of for a C# course I was taking. The project was to workin a group and create a game using Monogame, a framework designed for making games using C#.  This game was known as LiveWire, a platformer where you play as a little robot that is trying to relight the world after the power goes out.  The original plan was for the player to drag wires, found in specified wire depots, around the map, with it being able to interact with certain machines to make certain things appear and disappear, such as platforms and doors.  But the wire has a downside, it has a finite length, so you have to choose the best path to make it to the stations.  We were unable to add in the wire stations, so we ended up giving the wire infinite length to show off the physics of the wire.  The platforms and doors were implemented into the level, giving the player a bit of a platform challenge.  I was in charge of level design and playtesting, but also helped other members with any issues that they ended up having when it came to their parts of the project.  I also gave some ideas when it came to the overall gameplay loop and game genre, with some being used in the final project.
