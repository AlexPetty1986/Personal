This was a group project that I was a part of, this project was creating a game using C#.
This game was known as LiveWire, a platformer where you play as a little robot that is
trying to relight the world after the power goes out.  I focused mainly on the level 
design and troubleshooting, but also helped other members with any issues that they 
ended up having when it came to their parts of the project.  I also gave some ideas
when it came to the overall gameplay loop and game genre, with some being used in the
final project.
